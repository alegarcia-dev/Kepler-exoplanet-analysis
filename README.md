### Project Goals

Identify drivers of the exoplanet archive disposition to determine which attributes are most likely to be predictive of the dispositions of confirmed exoplanet or false positive.

### Project Description

The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-built telescope dedicated to searching for exoplanets in star systems besides our own, with the ultimate goal of possibly finding other habitable planets. The Kepler Space Observatory is retired as of October 30, 2018, but all the data it collected can be accessed from the NASA Exoplanet Archive [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative), or from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results). Observations in the Kepler Object of Interest table were made using the transit method for identifying exoplanets in other star systems. The transit method involves measuring the light intensity of a host star over time and looking for periodic dips in light intensity which signify an object eclipsing the host star, which could potentially indicate the presence of an exoplanet.

### What Should The End Result Be?

The goal of this project (in regards to final deliverables) is to provide reproducible and reusable work. The deliverables are as follows:

- A reproducible ipython notebook providing an overview of the project, all steps taken, and key takeaways.
- .py files that can be used to reproduce all steps taken.

### Initial Questions

### Who is The Audience?

This project is intended for a general audience so technical language is kept to a minimum. For those interested, technical details can be found in the working notebooks in the notebooks directory, or within the .py files.
